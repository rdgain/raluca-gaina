  abstract={{Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) has shown particular success in General Game Playing (GGP) and General Video Game Playing (GVGP) and many enhancements and variants have been developed. Recently, an on-line adaptive parameter tuning mechanism for MCTS agents has been proposed that almost achieves the same performance as off-line tuning in GGP.}},
